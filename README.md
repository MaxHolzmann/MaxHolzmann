# Introduction ðŸ‘‹

Hello! My name is Maximilian Holzmann, and I'm based out of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin. I am currently a student in University of Minnesota's Full Stack Bootcamp for web development. 

Outside of Web Development, I have many hobbies. I love to sing with my community choir and with my [acapella quartet](https://maxholzmann.github.io/blueberriesmusic/). I prioritize working out and staying active every day, through many activities such as running or pick up basketball. I also volunteer on the Board of Directors in two community organizations, through South Shore Chorale and United Way Fond du Lac.

I am also an active Real Estate Investor, and hold my Real Estate license in the state of Wisconsin.
